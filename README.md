### ***Description***

#### "Breakout" the name rings a bell for many early gamers. I was born long past it's inception, but I played my fair share of it on my family's computer. "Breakout" was the child of all things we know when it comes to mobile phones. It was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak's first major project back in 1976. The game pulled in a whopping $300 a day when it first came out. This will be my take on the iconic game from 1976. It won't make $1,564 in today's money, but I hope you enjoy it nevertheless.
